Keep it proper and have compatible outputs.\n\n## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->\n\n- Inconsistent up, front and scale\n- Not standardized format\n\n## Considered Options\n\n- FBX\n- BVH\n- GLTF2\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nGLTF2 is the only choice because FBX and BVH are not standardized formats. Not BVH or FBX because they do not standardize on up, front or scale.\n\n### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Standardized import gives better data for learning\n- Expect better gain\n- Godot supports GLTF2\n\n### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->\n\n- Requires blender tooling\n- GLTF2 is not a standard format\n- Needs a GLTF2 python library\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->\n\n### FBX\n\nFBX can be an interchange format.\n\n- Good, because it is the most common\n- Good, because it is already coded to work\n- Bad, because FBX does not have a spec.\n\n### BVH\n\nBVH is a way to import and export animations.\n\n- Good, because it already is here\n- Good, because no extra code\n- Bad, because there was great difficulty finding Euler order, up, scale and forward\n\n### GLTF2\n\nGLTF is a new open specification 3d interface format.\n\n- Good, because it is a standard\n- Good, because we don't have problems with 3d conventions\n- Good, because I have experience with GLTF2 and less with the other formats.\n- Bad, because python libraries to handle gltf2 may be underbaked\n- Bad, because some work needs to be done\n\n#### GLTF2 Pipeline\n\n1. We ingest anything to one skeleton in Blender.\n1. Generate meshes for the bones\n1. Export to glTF2.\n1. Pick a python library that can read simple skin gltf2\n1. Read gltf2\n1. Input into ML PyTorch\n1. process\n1. Output into glTF2\n1. Trash mesh and recreate meshes\n1. Output glTF2\n\n## Links <!-- optional -->\n\n- [Taper only Blender Mesh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fire/kinetic-transfer-gan/master/docs/attachments/mesh_blender_only_tapered.py)"},"creationDate":"2021-02-14T00:35:43.000Z","lastEditDate":"2021-02-14T01:40:07.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"K.
