The code in the utils directory is mostly taken from [Holden et al. [2016]](http://theorangeduck.com/page/deep-learning-framework-character-motion-synthesis-and-editing).
In addition, part of the MoCap dataset is taken from [Adobe Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/) and from the work of [Xia et al.](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/jchai/projects/SIG15/style-final.pdf).
